<strong>Docker</strong> Inc. was founded by Solomon Hykes and Sebastien Pahl during the <br>
Y Combinator Summer 2010 startup incubator group and launched in 2011.[10] Hykes<br>
started the <strong>Docker</strong> project in France as an internal project within dotCloud,<br>
a platform-as-a-service company.[11]<br>

<strong>Docker</strong> debuted to the public in Santa Clara at PyCon in 2013.[12] It was <br>
released as open-source in March 2013.[13] At the time, it used LXC as its default<br>
 execution environment. One year later, with the release of version 0.9, <strong>Docker</strong><br>
 replaced LXC with its own component, which was written in the Go programming language.[14][15]<br>

In 2017, <strong>Docker</strong> created the Moby project for open research and development.[16]<br>
